# S-Tier-Stack

### package manager / pnpm

npm is slow, yarn is weird and bun is still to new and not supported everywhere. pnpm is fast, simple & save.

### Monorepo / Turborepo

A monorepo is a nobrainer nowadays, turborepo is the only viable solution, watch (this)[https://youtu.be/ezb2neX9pIU?si=4OqhbX6g9UxXYyxk] video if you'r curious.

### Styling System / Shadcn 

This is a style system that makes things easy & simple. 

### Style Language / TailwindCSS

Once you use it you will never go back. You gain so much speed. 

### Framework / Next.js

Plain React misses many features. Next.js is the most used Meta Framework, it has the biggest community and AI is well trained with it. Tanstack Start is to new and still in Beta, it misses many things, that Next.js has already solved.

### Database / Postgres + Drizzle 

Best experience currently. Convex is also a good choice but might not be suitable for all projects and needs new learning. For Database I suggest using neon db. Drizzle is a no-brainer it's faster and more convenient to use then Prisma. 

### Authentication / Better Auth

No Auth hosting anywhere, no free plan banners, you got all the control. Setup is damn simple.

### Hosting? 

You decide. Vercel is by far simplest.
